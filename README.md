# DESCRIPTION

Cys.sqlite is a single file database containing comprehensive coverage of cysteine disulfide bonds in the protein databank.  This repository contains the code used to build and update Cys.sqlite along with example scripts/queries. This repository is designed to facilitate the use and evolution of Cys.sqlite. The original (2018-12-22) and most recent version of the database can be downloaded from the following links:

- 2018-12-22:  <https://trc.nist.gov/jcim_cys.sqlite.gz>
- 2019-06-12:  <https://trc.nist.gov/cys.sqlite.gz>

The original version corresponds to that used in the associated publication, titled [Cys.sqlite: A structured-information approach to the comprehensive analysis of cysteine disulfide bonds in the Protein Databank](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00950).  Please cite the original article if Cys.sqlite or the code included here is useful to your research efforts.

### Database updates

Updates of Cys.sqlite will be carried out periodically.  The current update goal is quarterly or in response to requests posted as issues or emails.  Such requests are useful for gauging the interest in Cys.sqlite and the need for further development of the resource.
