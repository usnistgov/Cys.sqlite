# DESCRIPTION

Cys.sqlite is a single file database containing comprehensive coverage of cysteine disulfide bonds in the protein databank.  This repository contains the code used to build and update Cys.sqlite along with example scripts/queries. This repository is designed to facilitate the use and evolution of Cys.sqlite. The original (2018-12-22) and most recent version of the database can be downloaded from the following links:
